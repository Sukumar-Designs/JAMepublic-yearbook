        JAM Republic came into existence in the year 2022 A.D. when  <span style="color: #FB76FF;">J</span>ohn Sukumar, <span style="color: #FB76FF;">A</span>kash Rathi, and <span style="color: #FB76FF;">M</span>anny Buendia (hence <span style="color: #FB76FF;">J.A.M</span>) signed a lease agreement at the infamous apartment complex of 1420 Chicago Avenue - more commonly referred to as “The Blue Whale” by Gen-X Northwestern graduates. John and Akash had met in their intermediate German language class. Having found each other rather unremarkable, they did not plan to keep in touch after that quarter. However, after going to the gym together once, they discovered their mutual love for Weezer, off-brand meme culture, and degeneracy and have since developed a deep friendship. John met Manny through the notorious, anime-loving George Bianco. The three were frequent attendees of NU Power Lifting and NU Anime Club events. Upon realizing Manny was an “absolute cutie,” John introduced him to Akash at Foster Walker Dining Hall and the three of them agreed to live with each other. This marked the beginning of a legendary era rivaling the significance of Y2K and the dot com boom. In May of 2022, Akash and John threw a combined birthday party on South Beach. The vibes were so immaculate, they decided to continue their party endeavors at their apartment the following school year. Over the summer, the three of them brainstormed various ideas for party themes. The contender among these themes was a bar-mitzvah celebrating John’s Jewish heritage which he had rejected for over 20 years of his life. Akash’s grandmother even brought a yarmulka back from her trip to Israel. The party was an absolute success as guests reveled in the irony of the theme. From that point forward, the three roommates continued throwing parties with non-traditional themes including but not limited to Asbestos Awareness, M2 Max Chip Launch, and RIP Clifford the Big Red Dog. From JAM, we truly appreciate all of your commitments to the bit. We had so much fun at these parties because all of you came prepared to celebrate whatever wacky cause we thought of. Thank you all for showing up and making our senior year fantastic. We love all of you and can’t wait to see you guys, hopefully in the near future.
